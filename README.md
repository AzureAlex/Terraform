# Terraform
Terraform examples for me. Purpose: training and learning and later for use.

List of good Examples:

https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples 


main.tf
The main.tf file contains the actual resources that will be deployed. It also contains the Azure Resource Group definition and any defined variables.

outputs.tf
This data is outputted when terraform apply is called, and can be queried using the terraform output command.
